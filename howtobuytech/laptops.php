	<h2>Comparing office laptops</h2>
		<p>
			In order to compare laptops and find the best one for your needs, it is important to specify which
			software you intend to use. For example, most recent laptops will run the Office suite and a web browser 
			very easily.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, if you intend to use specific software, it is important to verify the requirements on the software's website, 
			keeping in mind that software tends to become more demanding with time and that you might want to use more than one at the 
			same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Processor:</b> <br>
			While you can mesure a processor's performance with <a href="http://www.cpubenchmark.net/">benchmarks</a>, 
			an Intel i3 or i5 is usually recommended.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Ram:</b> <br>
			The minimum standard is 4GB, which is more than enough for a simple office use.
		</p>
		<p>	
			<b>Disk space:</b> <br>
			500GB is the usual minimum and it will contain thousands of photos and hundreds of movies. However, Ultrabooks often 
			come with SSDs; it is then important to check the storage capacitiy, as 64GB SSDs will not hold a lot more than the 
			operating system. More info on SSDs <a href="#">here</a>.
		</p>
	<h2>Purchasing an office laptop</h2>
		<p>
			Les magasins d'informatique offrant souvent des prix compétitifs, acheter en ligne ne représente pas
			nécessairement une économie. Par ailleurs, il est à noter que les magasins égalent habituellement les
			prix en ligne sur présentation d'une preuve que le produit est disponible et incluant les frais de transport.
			Un portable de bureautique devrait coûter 400$ sauf s'il s'agit d'un Ultrabook.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since retail stores often match online prices when shown a proof of availability including shipping costs, 
			buying online is not always the cheapest option. The price of a good office laptop is around 400$.

	<h2>Comparing 3D modeling laptops</h2>
		<p>
			In order to compare 3d modeling desktop computers, it is important to verify the specified requirements for 
			the exact software that you intend to use on the software website, keeping in mind that software tends to get 
			heavier with time and that you might want to use more than one at the same time. <br><br>
			Also, laptops have a lower graphic performance/price ratio than desktops.
		</p>	
		<p>
			The following list is introductory; there are numerous <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/forum-35.html">forums</a> 
			out there that are entirely dedicated to comparing performance laptops.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Processor:</b> <br>
			The processor is mainly responsible for rendering speed and its performance is measured using
			<a href="http://www.cpubenchmark.net/">benchmarks</a>. An Intel i7 processor is usually recommended for 3D modeling.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Graphic card:</b> <br>
			While a modeling graphic card is recommended, many people will opt for a gaming card because of their lower price. Graphic cards are also 
			compared using <a href="http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/">benchmarks</a> and they help the viewport display speed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Ram:</b> <br>
			The recommended amount of ram varies between 8 and 16GB; while it does not accelerate the rendering process, the computer may crash if it runs 
			out of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Disk space:</b> <br>
			Some Ultrabooks may face a storage problem due to the storage capacity of their SSDs. However, if the laptop is a regular one, the disk space will 
			not be a problem and <a href="#">adding an SSD</a> may help with heavier software.
		</p>
	<h2>Purchasing a 3D modeling laptop</h2>
		<p>
			Buying your modeling laptop online is often the best option considering the wide choice of available configurations. However, some in-store latops 
			(often gaming laptops) may suffice for 3D modeling. The price of a modeling laptop usually ranges from 1000 to 1500$.
		</p>
		<p>
			In conclusion, following the purchase of any computer, it is important to <a href="#">make a backup save</a> 
			and to <a href="#">optimize it</a>.

	<h2>Comparing gaming laptops</h2>
		<p>
			In order to compare gaming computers, it is important to verify the requirements of the games you intend to play on their official 
			website, as they vary greatly from one game to another. You also have to keep in mind that newer video games tend to be heavier and 
			that the maximum and minimum requirements of a video game may vary greatly as well. 
			<br><br>
			Also, laptops have a lower graphic performance/price ratio than desktop computers, and they tend to become very hot fast.

		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Graphic card:</b> <br>
			The graphic card is the most important part of a gaming laptop. It is very important to compare their 
			<a href="http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/">performance</a> and their price in order to find the best for your needs.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Ram:</b> <br>
			Usual ram recommendations for gaming laptops vary between 4 and 8GB.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Disk space:</b> <br>
			While storage capacity usually isn't a problem, <a href="#">adding an SSD</a> might be interesting.
