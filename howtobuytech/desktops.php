	<h2>Comparing office desktop computers</h2>
		<p>
			In order to compare desktop computers and find the best one for your needs, it is important to specify which
			software you intend to use. For example, most recent desktop computers will run the Office suite and a web browser 
			very easily.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, if you intend to use specific software, it is important to verify the requirements on the software's website, 
			keeping in mind that software tends to become more demanding with time and that you might want to use more than one at the 
			same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Processor:</b> <br>
			While you can mesure a processor's performance with <a href="http://www.cpubenchmark.net/">benchmarks</a>, 
			most recent processors will suffice for an office use.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Ram:</b> <br>
			The minimum standard is 4GB, which is more than enough for a simple office use.
		</p>
		<p>	
			<b>Disk space:</b> <br>
			500GB is the usual minimum and it will contain thousands of photos and hundreds of movies. <br>
			Adding an SSD might be interesting; more info <a href="#">here</a>
		</p>
	<h2>Purchasing an office desktop computer</h2>
		<p>
			Since retail stores often match online prices when shown a proof of availability including shipping costs, 
			buying online is not always the cheapest option. The price of a good office computer is around 400$ not 
			including the <a href="monitors.php">monitor</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			In conclusion, following the purchase of any computer, it is important to <a href="#">make a backup save</a> 
			and to <a href="#">optimize it</a>.

	<h2>Comparing 3D modeling desktop computers</h2>
		<p>
			In order to compare 3d modeling desktop computers, it is important to verify the specified requirements for 
			the exact software that you intend to use on the software website, keeping in mind that software tends to get 
			heavier with time and that you might want to use more than one at the same time.
		</p>	
		<p>
			The following list is introductory; there are numerous <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/forum-31.html">forums</a> 
			out there that are entirely dedicated to building custom workstations.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Processor:</b> <br>
			The processor is mainly responsible for rendering speed and its performance is measured using
			<a href="http://www.cpubenchmark.net/">benchmarks</a>. An Intel i7 processor is usually recommended for 3D modeling.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Graphic card:</b> <br>
			While a modeling graphic card is recommended, many people will opt for a gaming card because of their lower price. Graphic cards are also 
			compared using <a href="http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/">benchmarks</a> and they help the viewport display speed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Ram:</b> <br>
			The recommended amount of ram varies between 8 and 64GB; while it does not accelerate the rendering process, the computer may crash if it runs 
			out of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Disk space:</b> <br>
			Disk space is not a problem; however, adding an SSD is advised. More info <a href="#">here</a>.

	<h2>Purchasing a 3D modeling computer</h2>
		<p>
			While it is possible to find a good modeling computer in a retail store, there are numerous 
			<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1yg8xg/dos_donts_and_tips_for_first_time_bulders/">online ressources</a> 
			dedicated to personalized configurations. However, if you choose to build your own workstation, you must make sure 
			to have the right power supply and motherboard, among other things. Good modeling PCs start around 700$.

	<h2>Comparing gaming desktop computers</h2>
		<p>
			In order to compare gaming computers, it is important to verify the requirements of the games you intend to play on their official 
			website, as they vary greatly from one game to another. You also have to keep in mind that newer video games tend to be heavier and 
			that the maximum and minimum requirements of a video game may vary greatly as well.

			<a href="http://www.build-gaming-computers.com/gaming-desktop-computer.html">forums</a> entirely dedicated to building custom gaming PCs.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Processor:</b> <br>
			While processor speeds are measured using <a href="http://www.cpubenchmark.net/">benchmarks</a>, stock processors in recent desktop computers 
			usually suffice for gaming.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Graphic card:</b> <br>
			The graphic card is the most important part of a gaming PC. It is very important to compare their prices and 
			<a href="http://www.videocardbenchmark.net/">performance</a> in order to find the right model once you have established your requirements.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Ram:</b> <br>
			The recommended amount of ram for gaming varies between 4 and 8GB.
