	<h2>Comparing tablets</h2>
		<p>
			In order to compare tablets, you must determine which apps you intend to use. While most tablets will suffice for a simple office use 
			(browsing the web, reading e-mails), HD Gaming may require an iPad or comparable since the latest iPad is often used as a standard for 
			tablet gaming.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Screen size:</b> <br>
			The screen size usually varies between 7'', 8'' or 10'' and is a matter of personal choice. Keep in mind that screen size influences the tablet's 
			price and weight.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Network connection:</b> <br>
			While some tablets can only connect to the WiFi, others can connect to the mobile network, which influences the tablet's price in addition to the 
			mandatory contract.
		</p>
	<h2>Purchasing a tablet</h2>
		<p>
			Since retail stores usually match online prices when shown a proof of availability including shipping costs, buying online is not always cheaper. 
			However, accessories such as the case, cables and adapters are often cheaper online. A tablet should cost between 250 and 600$.
		</p>
		<p>
			In conclusion, following the purchase of any tablet, it is important to <a href="#">configure and optimise it</a>.
