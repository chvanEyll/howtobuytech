<h1>About us</h1>

<!--content-->
		<p>
			Our objective at HowtobuyTech.com, like the headline says, is to offer a starting point to your purchasing process. While we do not offer deeply technical 
			details, our mission is to introduce the elements which deserve your attention during the process in the most concise way possible. 
		</p>
		<p>
			After working for several years as technology salespeople, we have noticed how difficult it can be for consumers to spot the few important specs in technology 
			products, making their purchasing process needlessly daunting. In other words, do not stick to this website; rather, use it as a starting point to spot which 
			specs are important to you, and search engines then become your best friends in finding deals and product reviews.
